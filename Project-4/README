**Fonts**
1. Lato
2. Slabo
3. Not sure what I'm going to do with font color yet,
I'm thinking white, but it might be hard to read on the
intro section. ( Ended up going with a darker color because
white was to weird and hard to see)

I had some trouble getting the boxes to do what I wanted them to do.
I finally just changed my mind, because I have to get to other projects. It turned
out okay though, just wish I had more time. If anything, my understanding of CSS
and how to organize before I start working improved, organization especially. It is
way easier to get this done when you sketch it out. I had worked with wireframes before
in a photoshop class, so luckily I already had so preset 12 column wireframe to
work with.

I found this whole weeks material to be very interesting. Breakpoints, media queries,
and flexboxes have me excited to see where this all can go. I guess I know what I'll
be doing over winter break!
