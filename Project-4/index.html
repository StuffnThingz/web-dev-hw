        <h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>


      <h1> What is it? </h1>

      <p>
        Responsive Web Design (RWD) is what makes our web pages function on all devices,
        whether it's a smart phone, tablet, or PC. It keeps the our sites aesthectically pleasing
        and usable no matter what the screen size is.
      </p>

      <h1> Why use it? </h1>

      <p>
        As web developers, we want the user to keep coming back to our site. They're
        not going to keep coming back if they're constantly having to swipe the screen
        larger and scroll back and forth to see what's on the page. RWD allows us to
        build one site for any device and happens to be a huge time saver in the process.
      </p>

      <h1> Process </h1>

      <p>
        Some basic terminology you'll hear when discussing RWD: </br>

        <strong>Viewport -</strong> This sets the visible area of our page. It is set in your html
        head and is one of the first things to consider when it comes to RWD. </br>

        <strong>Flexbox -</strong> This allows boxes to grow or shrink as we resize our browser
        window. It also allows us to order boxes any way we like</br>

        <strong>Wireframe -</strong> Wireframing is how we create a sketch of our webpages using
        a grid system. Making a sketch of how we want our site to look and flow will save us time when it
        comes to coding. In the wireframing process, it's also important to consider our
        color scheme and font choices. It's really just about organization.</br
