**This weeks tasks**
1. Make Instructable HTML site.
2. Take Quiz 1.
3. Complete Peer Review section.


The html part wasn't too hard for me.  The book is a life saver.  For some reason I thought we had to have a full functioning website done by Monday.  Then I realized this was just one part of the next few weeks. I had some trouble remembering exactly how to get our readme and website live. I think now that I have done it a couple of times, the process will go much smoother.
