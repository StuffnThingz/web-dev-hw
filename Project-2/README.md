I was a little rusty starting off this week due to having no practice last week. The only problem I ran into, was linking my images properly. I felt really dumb when I found out all I had to do was add an extra period to link back two folders.  Besides that, I really just experimented. I made good use of the examples in the book, as well as the inspect feature in Chrome. It was nice to look at other people's code to get an idea of how I need to order everything.
