1. Continue Instructable HTML site.
2. Make About Me page.
3. Make More-Info page.

Didn't have too much trouble this week. The only thing I got caught up on
was my youtube video link not working, but it was just because I was pressing
enter to get the code to fit on one side of my Atom screen.

I experimented with the div tag, but still don't fully understand it. Once I finish
the rest of my homework, I'm going to go back and mess around with it.

I didn't find a chance to use the span tag, but it seems like a simple enough
idea.

The iFrame attribute was probably the most interesting thing I learned this week.
I need to try the poster attribute at some point.

Overall, I feel like this is all getting easier to understand. I wish I had time
to just focus on coding.
