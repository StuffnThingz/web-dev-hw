    <p>
      My names is Tobin Long, and I'm a Media Arts student at the
      University of Montana. I'm new to coding, but find it fascinating,
      and I'm going to take as many coding classes as I can.

        I made this site as a project for MART 341. I chose to do a very
        simple recipe so I could focus on the actual coding. I tried making
        the recipe my self, and it didn't turn out well. It's a work in
        progress I suppose.

        On this page, I've included some directions to the school I'm
        attending, and some fun audio and video for you to enjoy.  There
        will be more of this on the following page, "More Stuff."  Go check
        it out!
