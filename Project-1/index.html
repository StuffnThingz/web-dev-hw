      <p>Purple haze, all in my brain
        Lately things they don't seem the same <br />
        Actin' funny, but I don't know why
        Excuse me while I kiss the sky <br />
        Purple haze, all around
        Don't know if I'm comin' up or down<br />
        Am I happy or in misery?
        What ever it is, that girl put a spell on me <br />
