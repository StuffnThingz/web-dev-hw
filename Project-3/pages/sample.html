            But there were to be no angelic rescues on the overcast morning
            of September 18, 1970, and the circumstances and choices that
            led Jimi to this hotel room, and this fate, were solely of his
            making. Though a young woman was sleeping near him, she was a
            stranger really, and Jimi was, for all practical purposes, alone
            with his fate. Sometime during the early morning, around the time
            when the rest of London was waking up, he passed away. As he had
            predicted just two weeks before in an interview in Denmark, he did
            not live to see his twenty-eighth birthday. He was twenty-seven
            years old, and it was just five days short of the four-year
            anniversary of his first arrival in London.
