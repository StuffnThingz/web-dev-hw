## HW-04

1. I'd like to do based on an Jimi Hendrix's Bio, *A Room Full of Mirrors*. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/Room-Full-Mirrors-Biography-Hendrix/dp/0786888415) is a link for some info on the book.
3. The authors name is Charles R. Cross, who has written a lot of biographies on famouse musicians including several about Kurt Cobain.
4. Here is a screenshot of a color palette I might use. I'm a little color blind, so I just went to the adobe color site and typed in "music." Looks like the feel I'm going for.

5. For the fonts, I'm going with a Serif for the headings. I wanted to go for "vintage" theme. The font I'll use for the body is called open sans serif, which is still really readable.

## HW-05

I had an idea in my head for how I wanted my site to look, but it might
have been a little more complicated than it needed to be for a first time CSS project. There was a lot of information to skip through the last week, so there was lots of reading, and re-reading the material to find what I needed to get the job done.

I didn't have any trouble as far as gathering fonts, color schemes, and images I think I have that part down at this point.

What I struggled with, was just keeping track of all the stuff on the style.css page.  There was a couple things I used that I didn't really understand like "aside" and "flex." That's one thing I had to post in the issues forum. I'll keep working with it to see what I all does, especially the flex property. I wanted to get my buttons that link to other pages in a row, but couln't figure it out. I saw another student figured it out, so maybe I'll go back and see how they did it. One other thing I couldn't figure out was how to center the text in my hover button. I thought I did everything right, but nope. I'd love to work on this more, but I have other classes to get to.
