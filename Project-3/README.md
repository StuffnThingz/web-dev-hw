1. I'd like to do based on an Jimi Hendrix's Bio, *A Room Full of Mirrors*. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/Room-Full-Mirrors-Biography-Hendrix/dp/0786888415) is a link for some info on the book.
3. The authors name is Charles R. Cross, who has written a lot of biographies on famouse musicians including several about Kurt Cobain.
4. Here is a screenshot of a color palette I might use. I'm a little color blind, so I just went to the adobe color site and typed in "music." Looks like the feel I'm going for.

5. For the fonts, I'm going with a Serif for the headings. I wanted to go for "vintage" theme. The font I'll use for the body is called open sans serif, which is still really readable.
